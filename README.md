**How Does it Work?**

When you press a keybind (set to 'U' by default (configurable)) or enter a chat command (set to 'score' by default (configurable)) it shows a menu with a list of online player id's along with their unique identifiers, it also shows a Draw3DText UI above every nearby player's head (including yourself) with their player ID in it.
